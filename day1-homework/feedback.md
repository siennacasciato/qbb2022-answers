### Exercise 1

The "output" of the script refers to the text that is printed to your screen when you run your "corrected" script at the command line. It looks like you fixed it correctly (great job!)...what did it print, and did it make sense in light of what is known about different types of mutations (Google if necessary)?

### Exercise 2

One minor suggestion for "twofile" is to use the extension ".bed". This isn't necessary, but it helps you as the programmer to remember that it is indeed a bed formatted file. Nice work on this exercise!

Consider https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics) as an explanation for your observations.

### Exercise 3

Looks perfect...great work.
