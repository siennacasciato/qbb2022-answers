The output file "exons.chr21.bed.vcf" reports 1107407 bp. Output file "processed_pseudogene.chr21.bed.vcf" reports 956640 bp. Output file "protein_coding.chr21.bed.vcf" reports 13780687 bp.

Strategies to confirm the reproduced plots are the same as in the cache/ directory: We could open the plots that we reproduced and the plots in the cache/ directory and compare them to see if they look the same. We could also use the command line and write code that could compare the files, such as reproduced plot == cache plot. We could run the code and see if the plots are identical.

One gene type that I find interesting is the unprocessed pseudogene, because they all mostly seem to be exons so I would be interested to know what each gene does. Another gene type I find interesting is the transcribed processed pseudogene because I would want to see the difference between the unprocessed and processed pseudogenes and if they have the same functions. Another gene type that I find interesting is the protein coding genes because I want to see their role in the organism.
