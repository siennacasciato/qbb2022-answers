3. There is a significant relationship between maternal age and maternally inherited de novo mutations because the p-value is 6.878208e-24, which is less than 0.05. The size of this relationship is 0.3776, which means that as a mother ages, the mutations increase by a coefficient of 0.3776. This means that when the mother gets one year older, the chance of another mutation occurring increases by 0.3776.

4. There is a significant relationship between paternal age and paternally inherited de novo mutations because the p-value is  1.552294e-84, which is less than 0.05. The size of this relationship is 1.3538, which means that as a father ages, the mutations increase by a coefficient of 1.3538. This means that when the father gets one year older, the chance of another mutation occurring increases by 1.3538.

6. There is a significant difference between the number of maternally and paternally inherited de novo mutations per proband, because the p-value was 6.664949e-15, which is significant because it is less than 0.05.

7. Using the equation y=mx+b, I substituted the variables for numbers that were calculated by Python using the data of the father's age and the father's number of de novo mutations. Based on the equation, I predict that a proband with father who is 50.5 years old will have 78.6932 paternal de novo mutations.
