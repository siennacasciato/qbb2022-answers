## Exercise 1

Please upload the commands that you used to wrangle the data in unix

## Exercise 2, questions 1-2

Great plots!

## Exercise 2, questions 3-4 size of relationship

Could you clarify specifically what you mean by "The size of this relationship is 0.3776, which means that as a mother ages, the mutations increase by a coefficient of 0.3776" and "The size of this relationship is 1.3538, which means that as a father ages, the mutations increase by a coefficient of 1.3538."?

## Exercise 2, question 5

I saw the code for the histogram in the python script, but did not see the histogram; please add the figure

## Exercise 2, question 6

Use a hypothesis test (like a paired t-test) or use a Poisson model. A linear model which uses the number of maternal DNMs as an independent variable and the number of paternal DNMs as the dependent variable is not appropriate. 

## Exercise 2, question 7

good job predicting!
