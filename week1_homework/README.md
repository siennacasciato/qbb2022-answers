#Week 1 Lab Assignment

1.1:
1Mbp x 5x = 5Mbp of data
5Mbp / 100bp = 50,000 reads

1Mbp x 15x = 15Mbp of data
15Mbp / 100bp = 150,000 reads


1.2:
see uploaded .png file.

1.3:
1,000 bp to 7,000 bp had not been sequenced. It does not match Poisson expectations because we expect Poisson distribution to be normal (form a bell shaped curve), which was not seen in the histogram produced.

1.4:
50,000 bp to 550,000 bp had not been sequenced. The Poisson distribution does not match the expectations because the distribution should show a bell shaped curve, but in the histogram it does not.


2.1:
```
grep -c '<' frag180.2.fq
