Great work! You nailed needleman-wunsch, there are just a few minor issues with your output:

We want your script to print out the alignment statistics we asked for (num gaps in each sequence, as well as the alignment score). I see that you have a README that has the number of gaps, but these numbers are actually slightly off, and it doesn't look like your script actually prints this info, so I'm not sure how you got those numbers (-1)

Otherwise, really great work. Nice job!
