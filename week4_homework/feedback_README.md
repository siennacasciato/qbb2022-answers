Great start! The PCA and AF plots both look awesome.

I'm not sure what you're going for with the `pd.read_csv()` command, as the syntax of that line is definitely not quite right. I'm also not sure you can just pass the entire dataframe to qmplot. If you can get `qmplot` to work, go for it, but remember that a manhattan plot is just a scatter plot of variant position (or index) vs. log10(pval), so it should be fairly straight-forward to do yourself (-4 points)

We still need your boxplot, and your response to question 7 (-2.5 points)

(3.5/10)
